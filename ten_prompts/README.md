# Minecraft-style Voxel Game

A functional Minecraft-style core gameplay loop with chunked world generation, physics, block placement/mining, and a showcase village.

## Features

- **Chunked World System**: 16x16x128 chunks with efficient voxel storage and meshing
- **Physics**: Gravity, jump, collision detection with blocks
- **Block System**: Mine with left click, place with right click. Switch between Stone (1) and Dirt (2)
- **Player Controller**: WASD movement, Space to jump, mouse look
- **Showcase Village**: Auto-generated village with house, farm, and 16m watchtower with torches
- **Passive Mobs**: 5 wandering mobs with separation behavior
- **Cinematic Mode**: Press F5 for 25-second flythrough of the village
- **HUD**: Crosshair, FPS counter, and controls display

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move
- **Space**: Jump
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Left Click**: Mine blocks
- **Right Click**: Place blocks
- **1/2**: Switch block type (Stone/Dirt)
- **F5**: Toggle cinematic flythrough
- **Click to enter**: Pointer lock for mouse look

## Running the Game

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

### Production Build & Run
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:4173

## Technical Details

- **TypeScript** with strict mode
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering with performance optimizations
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Simplex Noise** for terrain generation
- **Web Workers ready** for chunk meshing (can be extended)

## Performance

- Optimized for 50-60 FPS at 1080p
- Greedy meshing for efficient chunk rendering
- Frustum culling and object pooling
- 4 chunk render distance by default
- No postprocessing for better performance

## Village Features

The auto-generated village includes:
- Stone house with wooden roof and torches
- Farm with wheat crops and water irrigation
- 16-meter watchtower with torches and battlements
- Stone paths connecting structures
- Flat terrain around structures

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Project builds and runs with `npm run build && npm start`  
✅ Mine+place >50 blocks without FPS dropping below 30  
✅ Jump works, placement reach ≤5 units, 1/2 keys switch block types  
✅ Torches appear as bright spots, passive mobs wander, F5 cinematic works  
✅ No runtime errors during normal gameplay
